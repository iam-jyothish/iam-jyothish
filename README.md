# Hello 👋

I’m Jyothish K.

I enjoy teaching machines how humans move and slowly realizing that humans are harder to debug. I build AI-driven, 3D, and real-time systems where code meets motion, research meets curiosity, and deadlines meet optimism.

Currently navigating the life of an M.Tech Computer Science & Engineering scholar—balancing research papers, experiments, and the occasional “this worked yesterday” moment.
